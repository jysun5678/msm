The modulus of the elliptic curve can be modified at the top of the ec_point.hpp file. I choose q=3329 in this file.

The elliptic curve equation in this implementation is y^2=x^3+3. It can be modified in the ec_point.hpp file, where the elliptic curve equation is defined in the is_on_curve function.
